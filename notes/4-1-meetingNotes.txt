2 player mode ideas (DW)
  -1 snack to increase competition
  -chance of rainbow snack that allows players to cut through the enemy snack, be cool to make snake rainbow
    -other powerups? speed? +5 cubes

  having random rainbow instead of the whole gamemode being like that switches thing up in game
  whoever collides loses, head to head big boi wins
  
  2 player race
   - 120 seconds, any collision is automatic loss
   - highest score at 120 wins, no rainbow


ideas to draw scores
 static? or pass in xy, store locations in gs
