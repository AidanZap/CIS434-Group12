V1.0.1 Added functionality, snale can not turn 180 degrees
  todo:
    -add menu() (Aidan, Derek)
    -Score (toral)
    
V1.0.2 Started framwork for gamestate logic to keep the while loop organized
      -Discussed the coding goal of keeping the main loop clean, and using a OOP and method based approach
      
v1.0.3 Large Update, Menu was added by Aiden and live score by Toral
      -After that menu was moved into its own function and the button class was created with hover funtionality
      -Toral also created a score class
      -There was some merging errors since Toral and Derek were editing at the same time but they are all resolved
      -Some refactoring, colors are now at the top, two_player groundwork started, main game objects like font, surface and dimensions          are global. buttons list for quick drawing
