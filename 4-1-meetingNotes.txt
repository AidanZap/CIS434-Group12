2 player mode ideas (DW)
  -1 snack to increase competition
  -chance of rainbow snack that allows players to cut through the enemy snack, be cool to make snake rainbow
    -other powerups? speed? +5 cubes

  having random rainbow instead of the whole gamemode being like that switches thing up in game
  collisions subtract 10 blocks until death( turn the snake away or let go through?), keeps winning snake from suiciding for highscore win
  
  2 player race
   - 120 seconds, any collision is automatic loss
   - highest score at 120 wins, no rainbow
